# RogueCheems

A lightweight traditional roguelike scaffold built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Run locally

From the repository root:

```bash
cd roguecheems
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Sprite placeholders

Sprite references in `js/main.js` point to `assets/sprites/*.png`. Swap the placeholder `.txt`
files in `assets/sprites/` with your real `.png` sprites when they are ready.
